##Lessons Learned
Had to review: Great practice using ArrayLists, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces. Reading from a text file to populate the initial list of jets was challenging and interesting.

##MVP
Upon program start up, the AirField is populated with the list of jets. These are read from a text file where each line contains information for single jet. The program then displays a list of 9 options for the user to choose from.

- List fleet 
- Fly all jets 
- View fastest jet 
- View jet with longest range
- Load & Go 
- Race! 
- Add a jet to Fleet 
- Remove a jet from Fleet
- Quit

Fly option calls the entire fleet of jets to fly. While Load & Go and Race! are jet type specific options. User is also able to add or remove jets of their preference.
